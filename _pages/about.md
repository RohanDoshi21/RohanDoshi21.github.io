Diving deep into the world of distributed systems and the intricacies of backend engineering fuels my passion. My journey in mastering these realms began at the prestigious [Pune Institute of Computer Technology (PICT)](http://www.pict.edu), where I earned my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering.

Currently, I am working as a **Software Developer Intern** at **[Golain](https://golain.io/)** working on WebRTC. Leveraging the robust capabilities of PostgreSQL's Write-Ahead Logging (WAL), the versatile MQTT protocol for lightweight messaging, and the efficiency of Go for the entire backend architecture, we've crafted a resilient and scalable system.

I have worked on various projects in the field of distributed systems, backend engineering, and web development. I have experience in working with technologies like **Node.js, Go, Spring Boot, Redis, Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS**.

I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow. Feel free to reach out to me for any opportunities or collaborations.
